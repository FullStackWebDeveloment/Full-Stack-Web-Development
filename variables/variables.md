# Variables
### Storing the information you need — Variables

## What is a variable?
A variable is a container for a value, like a number we might use in a sum, or a string that we might use as part of a sentence.

## Declaring a variable
To use a variable, you've first got to create it — more accurately, we call this declaring the variable. To do this, we type the keyword `let` followed by the name you want to call your variable:

**Example:**

```js
let firstName;    // first name of a person
let lastName;    // last name of a person
let country;     // country
```
Here we're creating two variables called `firstName`,`lastName` and `country`.They currently have no value; they are empty containers. When you enter the variable names, you should get a value of undefined returned.

**Note:** 
`In JavaScript, all code instructions should end with a semicolon (;) — your code may work correctly for single lines, but probably won't when you are writing multiple lines of code together. Try to get into the habit of including it.`

## Initializing a variable
Once you've declared a variable, you can initialize it with a value. You do this by typing the variable name, followed by an equals sign `(=)`, followed by the value you want to give it

**Example:**

```js
let firstName = 'Sathish'    // first name of a person
let lastName = 'Sampath'      // last name of a person
let country = 'India'       // country
```
## You can declare and initialize a variable at the same time, like this:
```js
let firstName = 'Sathish'    // first name of a person
let lastName = 'Sampath'      // last name of a person
let country = 'India'       // country
```
